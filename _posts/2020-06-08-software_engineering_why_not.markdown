A year ago, if you had asked me about becoming a software engineer,  I would have registered it as a possiblity, but I never would have imagined that I would follow through with the idea. However, life has guided me on this path, and this is the path that I shall take. Nothing in life happens by chance. So, a year ago, when I found myself on a coding website exploring aspects of the site instead of completing the work that I should have been doing on the computer, I decided to delve more into a concept I had eluded for years. My interests have always leaned more towards the arts: drawing, playing guitar, and writing. Math and technology were always subjects that I found puzzling. I  always admired them from an outsider's view of feeling competent, but not confident enough to engage in either topic in anything more than a superficial way. However, the more time I spent on that coding website, the more I began to envision myself as someone more than just a mere observer. 

*Why do I have to observe? I can participate, and I will.*

Once I changed from viewing technology from an outsider's perspective to acknowledging that I have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way, I surged forward looking to cultivate the desire for knowing more about technology. Perusing varioius coding sites and resources lead me towards the idea of delving into software engineering in particular. Software engineering appealed to me because it encompasses some of the things that I was feared, math and technology, yet it also encompasses some things that are beneficial to life in general. Critical thinking, problem solving, and logic are concepts that are definitely applied in software engineering, but of course they also extend to help you knock out of the park those curveballs that life sometimes throw at you. In such a tech-driven world, it is difficult to imagine continuing my life as simply a mere observer or admirer of technology. So, when asked why software engineering, my response is --

***Why not?***
